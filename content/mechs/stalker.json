    "description": "Heavily armored close combat specialised mech. Stalker is equipped with dual proton pulsators that shoot in bursts of protonic charges, dealing massive damage at close range. Stalkers cannot be manufactured on the surface, so they are constructed on mothership and are sent to the drop points on request. Please do not toss them at enemies' meltdowns and spectres, Stalkers are quite expensive.",
